What is meant by correlation? Correlation is a statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related (meaning they change together at a constant rate). It's a common tool for describing simple relationships without making a statement about cause and effect.

WE will calculate the correlation coefficient of temperature and ice-cream sales data

****

1. imports numpy library in code. (Make sure numpy is pre-installed using pip3 install numpy earlier)

2. Convert temperature data and ice-cream sales data into arrays. Make sure that each data set is converted into a float value first. (by default each data set is a string)  what are arrays 

3. Use corrcoef() function and pass the two datasets to it. Store the output in a variable. 

4. Print the correlation coefficient on the screen
